Enable SwiftKey prediction on more fields
=========================================

Based on an idea by acid-world: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1943057, although the implementation used here is different, as I didn't want the password fields with prediction enabled, or on fields where autocompletion has been requested to be disabled by the person who wrote the program with the text field.

Enabled on email address, website, and filter list fields. No configuration for this; (un-)comment the bits where you do or do not want SwiftKey running and recompile.
